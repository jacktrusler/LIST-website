# LIST-Website

A homepage for a friend who works in IT. Made using react.
The website is hosted on digital ocean at [listsm.art](listsm.art)

## Why I made the site

I both wanted some experience in coding a react website and I wanted to make something fun for a friend who was thinking about starting some freelance work in IT. The website utilizes some of the functional ideas of react such as state / lifecycle methods and also makes use of modules by separating components into different .js files and serves the components in a dynamic way.
